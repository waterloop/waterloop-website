# Contact Form Component

Purpose:
Provide a contact form.

How to create:
Pass title (tile) and description (desc) as string props. The form mimics a Google Form and will post to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdkZ6LFnsW6oVMePd_MVk_3bmP3OWwPhJ1xSJca1bPiU7MKg/viewform.


Notes:
Responsive formatting when width of screen is less than 500 px.
DO NOT CHANGE the "name" property of input. That's where the data is bound to Google Form.
