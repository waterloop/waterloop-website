Recruitment Form Readme

Purpose: Displays open positions on Waterloop for interested students to apply for.

How to initialize:

  a "PositionPosting" component takes in a:
    role (prop: role),
    description of the role (prop: description),
    skills required (prop: skills),
    technical question (prop: technicalQ),
    string array of 5 terms that the student can apply for (prop: termList).

  A "Form" child component is displayed when the Join button is clicked, allowing the user to fill in the relevant information.
  inputs from forms go to this google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmZSfD1Hs0D3MLBjAfdUkaCb3GJJxIvKUEVJCBf5hVxZTt4g/viewform
  inputs from forms go to this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jESjYao0VSQgLAGF2Nkm7z0-47JYmuBbU9OR4DZwnQo/edit?usp=sharing
  BOTH LINKS ARE ON VIEW ONLY

How to update Form:
  To update field names and  ids go to the `./hooks/recruitment-form`
  and Look at the UPDATE ME Section
  Some work will be needed to update the reducer if
  you choose to change the data interface, but adding and removing fields
  should not take much effort, so long as the data stays in the same format.
