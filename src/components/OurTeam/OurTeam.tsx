    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>
      Our team is a diverse group of student volunteers from all faculties.
      Whether it’s laying out a test board design to evaluate a high power
      electrical component, simulating the magnetic effects of a change in
      motor geometry, writing a reliable embedded communication driver, or
      creating media and content to increase adoption of the Hyperloop
      concept, we’re united in the pursuit of building and learning amazing
      things together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interested in joining? We’re always looking for dedicated team members
      to help us make the vision of Hyperloop a reality, and we work hard to
      provide an effective mentorship experience for all new team members.
    </p>
