# FeaturedComponent.tsx

The `FeaturedComponent.tsx` driver component loads the data in `extFeatModels.json` in the order that they were defined using a helper function that generates `SimpleFeatComp` components dynamically.

NOTE: **Images should be imported manually.** There's an array declared in `FeaturedComponent.tsx` that stores those images.
