To promote the innovation necessary for a Hyperloop-enabled future, we’re constructing Canada’s first Hyperloop track right here in Waterloo with the intent to host a competition to promote further innovation, create real-world testing opportunities for transportation researchers, and scale up to a full-scale demonstration by 2025."

        "text": "Contactless propulsion is critical for durability and reliability at the high speed of a full-scale Hyperloop, so for two years we’ve been developing a custom linear induction motor. With ANSYS electromagnetic sims, manufacturing from steel core and copper coils, design of a custom multi-kW controller board, and carefully optimizing real-time control systems, we’re constantly inventing solutions to incredibly difficult problems."

        "text": "The Canadian Hyperloop Conference (CHC) is an idea formed by 6 universities during late 2019 - early 2020 who were interested in organizing their own track race after the SpaceX Hyperloop competition was discontinued. The Canadian Hyperloop Conference aims to host its own track race under the supervision of Waterloop who will be hosting and competing in the event at their track located at the Waterloo International Airport, which is also Canada’s first Hyperloop track.",
