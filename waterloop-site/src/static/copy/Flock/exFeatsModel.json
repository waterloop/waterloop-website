Guidance wheels hold the LIM at a distance from the track measured in mere millimeters, and the mechanical brakes automatically actuate in the unlikely scenarios of loss of communications, electrical power, or pneumatic pressure."

Our dashboard additionally gives us fine-grained, fail-safe control over everything the pod does during a test run."
